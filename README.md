# Welcome to Raiz Carpintería de diseño!

The project consists of developing a web app for Raiz Carpintería de Diseño, a young and committed factory, in charge of building personal spaces required by customers


## Project details:
The project is worked with technologies such as JavaScript, Next.js, Material UI, and using the Email.js API. 

It consists of 3 sections, the first one is the Home section where you can find a presentation banner in which you can also find information about the company and the contact from its social networks. The second one, shows the products designed and filtered with their detailed descriptions, and a modal to see the image bigger. The last section shows a contact form so that any person/company can send a message by mail with their respective data and message. Finally, at the bottom of the page is my portfolio in case you want to contact me through it



## Steps to view the site


In our default terminal, we clone the folder by typing "git clone" + link:

1- git clone https://github.com/Jcruzcorti/raizcarpinteria

2- Then, we place ourselves in the root folder of the project, with the command "cd raizcarpinteria" and install all the dependencies inside with the command "npm install".

3-Finally, in the terminal we carry out the command "npm run dev" or "yarn dev" and the web will open in the predetermined browser after a few seconds/minutes of waiting.
